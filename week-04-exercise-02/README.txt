Week 04 Exercise 02 — DevTools Vandalism (Part 2)

What you still need to do manually in your browser (instructions):

1. Open any well-known website (e.g., youtube.com, ttu.edu, apple.com) in your web browser.
2. Right-click anywhere and choose "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
3. In the Elements panel, double-click a headline or other prominent text to edit it. Change it to something funny/interesting.
4. In the Styles panel, edit at least two CSS properties for an element (e.g., change font-size, color, background-color).
5. When you're happy with the page, take a screenshot of the most interesting part of your modified page.
6. Save that screenshot to this folder and name it something simple, e.g., devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png
7. Replace the placeholder PNG in this folder with your screenshot. The HTML already points to devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png.
8. Open `week-04-exercise-02/index.html` in VS Code and update the heading/paragraphs to describe which site you modified and what edits you made.
9. Commit and push your changes using GitHub Desktop.

Notes:
- I created a tiny 1×1 placeholder PNG so you can preview the page layout. Replace it with your real screenshot before committing.
- The placeholder is already named devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png to match what the HTML expects.
